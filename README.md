# Task Manager (working title)
##Summary
This task management system will be useful and unique in a number of ways:
 1. A Gantt chart viewer for tasks will make it easier to see what tasks need to get done when
 2. Progress can be tracked either through checklists (finishing tasks) or user-controlled
    progress for tasks like writing a paper
 3. Tasks, projects, and categories will be very easy to add, probably through a single textbox
 4. The application will (hopefully) be aesthetically pleasing, using some relevant concepts
    from Google's new design specification, Material Design
